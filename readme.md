Rebase exercise

This repo has two branches:

- master
- feature/x

Your goal: You want the feature x branch to be 1 commit ahead of master.

To accomplish your goal you should:

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork to your local computer
3. Use `git lola` to visualize the present state
4. Draw a picture with pen and paper of the desired end state
5. Google for the correct command to transition from present state to desired state
6. Run your command
7. Run `git lola` to see resultant state
8. Compare the result to the picture you drew. Did the command you ran behave like you thought it would?
9. Force push the updated `feature/x` branch to GitHub

*** Note: Force push can be dangerous. You should never use it on shared branches. ***
